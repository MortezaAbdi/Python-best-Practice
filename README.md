# Python-best-Practice

This repository is a written vesion of Crash Corse in Python, avilable in courseara. 

Thought, this can get you fast up and runing in python programming, and object object oriented programming. 

This repository is not contain the last week of the original course, which is of course optional in the course itself, although, I plan to add it. :)
