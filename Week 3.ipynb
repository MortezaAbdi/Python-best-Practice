    "## 1. For loops\n",
    "A for loop iterates over a sequence of values. A very simple example of a for loop is to iterate over a sequence of numbers, like this. Notice how the structure is kind of similar to the structures we've already seen. The first line indicates the distinguishing keyword. In this case, that's for. And it ends with a colon. The body of the loop is indented to the right, like we saw in the while loop, the if block, and the function definitions. What's different in this case is that we have the keyword in. Also, between the for keyword and in keyword, we have the name of a variable. This variable will take each of the values in the sequence that loop iterates through. So in this example, it'll iterate through a sequence of numbers generated using the range function. There are two important things I want to call out about this range function. First, in Python and a lot of other programming languages, a range of numbers will start with the value 0 by default. Second, the list of numbers generated will be one less than the given value. In the simple example here, x will take the values 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. Let's check this out."

    "The sequence that the for loop iterates over could contain any type of element, not just strings. For example, we could iterate over a list of numbers to calculate the total sum and average. Here's one way of doing this. Here, we're defining a list of values. After that, we're initializing two variables, some and length, that will update in the body of the for loop. In the for loop, we're iterating over each of the values in the list, adding the current value to the sum of values, and then also adding 1 to length, which calculates how many elements there are in the list. Once we've gone through the whole list, we print out the sum and the average. We'll keep using for loops in our examples every time we want to iterate over the elements of any sequence and operate with them. Some examples of sequences that we can iterate are the files in a directory, the lines in a file, the processes running on a machine. And there's a bunch of others."

    "You might be wondering why do we need recursive functions if I can just use a for or while loop? Well, solutions to some specific problems are easier to write and understand when using recursive functions. A lot of math functions like the factorial or the sum of all the previous numbers are good examples of this. If a math function is already defined in recursive terms, it's straightforward to just write the code as a recursive function. But it's not just about math functions. Let's check out a couple of examples of how this could help an IT specialist trying to automate tasks. Let's say that you need to write a tool that goes through a bunch of directories in your computer and calculates how many files are contained in each. When listing the files inside a directory, you might find subdirectories inside them and you'd want to count the files in those subdirectories as well. This is a great time to use recursion. The base case would be a directory with no subdirectories. For this case, the function would just return the amount of files. The recursive case would be calling the recursive function for each of the contained subdirectories. The return value of a given function call would be the sum of all the files in that directory plus all the files in the contained subdirectories. A directory of files that can contain other directories is an example of a recursive structure. Because directories can contain subdirectories that contain subdirectories that contain subdirectories, and so on. When operating over recursive structure, it's usually easier to use recursive functions than for or while loops. Another IT-focused example of a recursive structure is anything that deals with groups of users that can contain other groups. We see this situation a lot when using administrative tools like active directory or LDAP. Say your group management software allows you to create groups that have both users and other groups as their members. And you want to list all human users that are part of a given group. Here you would use a recursive function to go through the groups. The base case would be a group that only includes users listing all of them. The recursive case would mean going through all the groups contained listing all the users in them and then listing any users contained in the current group.\n",

    "Factorial(10000), See that error? It's telling us that we've reached the maximum limit for recursive calls. So while you can use recursion in a bunch of different scenarios, we only recommend using it when you need to go through a recursive structure that won't reach a thousand nested levels."
